# grpc-user-service
User Service to demonstrate the use of gRPC in Node.js

### Start the server

* npm run build
* npm run start

### Trigger the client in a separate terminal

* node src/client.js

Note: the build js files are in the same src, this will be moved to dist folder in future
This is just a skeleton repo and work will be done to improve the user service with proper
backend to save records and more API's
